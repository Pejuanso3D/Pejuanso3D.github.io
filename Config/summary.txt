As a dedicated 3D Character Artist based in Valencia, Spain, I bring a wealth of experience from my work on projects such as "Invicta: The Next Queen" and the creation of realistic characters like Jacky Calloway. My expertise spans hard-surface and organic modeling, sculpting human anatomy and clothing, game topology, UV layout, and PBR texturing, utilizing industry-standard tools such as 3ds Max, Zbrush, and Substance Painter. I am passionate about storytelling through character creation and am committed to delivering high-quality visuals and immersive experiences in every project I undertake.
